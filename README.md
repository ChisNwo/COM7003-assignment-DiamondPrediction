**PRICE PREDICTION OF DIAMONDS USING MACHINE LEARNING**

    
**OVERVIEW**


This repository contains a project on predicting the price of diamond using Machine Learning Models. The dataset for this project was gotten from Kaggle. 
The dataset have features ranging from carat weight to clarity. The aim was to develop a robust machine learning model that accurately forecast / predicts the price of diamonds.


**DATASET FEATURES**


The dataset includes the following columns:

•	  **carat**: Diamond weight in carat

•	  **cut**: Diamond cutting quality

•	  **colour**: Diamond colour ranging from J (worst) to D (best)

•  	**clarity**: Clarity measure from I1 (worst) to IF (best)

•	  **x**: Diamond length in mm

•  	**y**: Diamond width in mm

•  	**z**: Diamond depth in mm

•	  **depth**: Percentage depth (z / mean(x,y))

•	  **table**: Width of the widest point at the top of the diamond

•	  **price**: Target variable representing diamond price


**OBJECTIVES**


The main aim of the study is to explore the use of machine learning to predict diamond prices based on key features, like the 4Cs - carat weight, cut, clarity, and colour. 


The primary objective is:

•	  To explore the efficacy of machine learning algorithms in predicting diamond prices.

•	  To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the price of diamonds based on key features like carat, cut, clarity and colour.

•	  To compare the performance of four (4) models in predicting diamond prices.


**STEPS TAKEN**


1.	  **Data Exploration:** Analysed diamond attributes and their correlation with prices.
   
2.	  **Model Development:** Trained machine learning models to predict the price of diamonds.

3.	  **Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using appropriate metrics.
   
4.	  **Insights:** Extracted meaningful insights for diamond valuation.
